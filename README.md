# TF-Stack-Ensemble  
# Deep Ensemble Learning for Classification

## Project Overview

This project implements a sophisticated deep ensemble learning system that combines traditional machine learning models with a transformer-based stacking classifier. The system is designed to handle complex classification tasks by leveraging the strengths of multiple base models and using advanced deep learning techniques for meta-learning.

## Features

- Multiple optimized base classifiers (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, SVM).
- Automated hyperparameter optimization using grid search.
- Transformer-based stacking classifier with multi-head attention.
- Comprehensive performance evaluation and visualization.
- Cross-validation for robust model assessment.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deep-ensemble-learning.git
cd deep-ensemble-learning
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
python == 3.9  
pandas>=1.2.0
numpy>=1.19.0
scikit-learn>=0.24.0
xgboost>=1.4.0
tensorflow>=2.6.0
matplotlib>=3.3.0
seaborn>=0.11.0
```

## Usage

1. Prepare your data:
   - Data should be in CSV format
   - Features should be numerical
   - Target variable should be in a column named 'Cancer_tumor'

2. Run the main script:
```bash
python deep_ensemble.py
```

## Implementation Steps

1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Load data from CSV file.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Split data into training and test sets.
   - Scale features using StandardScaler.

2. Base Model Optimization:
   - Initialize BaseModelOptimizer.
   - Run grid search for each base model.
   - Evaluate models using cross-validation.

3. Stacking Classifier Training:
   - Create transformer-based meta-learner.
   - Train using base model predictions.
   - Apply early stopping and learning rate reduction.

4. Performance Evaluation:
   - Generate performance comparison plots.
   - Create ROC curves.
   - Calculate final model metrics.

## Output

The system generates several outputs:
1. Model performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
2. Performance comparison plots (saved as PDF)
3. ROC curves for all models (saved as PDF)
4. Detailed cross-validation results

## Customization

You can customize the following parameters:
- Number of cross-validation folds (default: 5)
- Grid search parameters for each base model
- Transformer architecture configuration
- Training parameters (batch size, epochs, etc.)
